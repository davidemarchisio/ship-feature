# followed by a stall phrase in one sentence, and no surface rule tells a quoted
# phrase from a real announcement.
#
# So the choice is which way to err. Rejecting this costs a failed round on a review
# that QUOTES a stall phrase — and the only body realistically doing that is a review
# of this very feature, which is how grok hit it. Accepting it costs the bug this
